## Overview

Before we can start programing a robot we must install the necessary software for programming and driving the robot. This section will go over:

- [Installing Development Tools: VSCode and Java](#installing-java-development-tools)
- [Installing the FRC Update Suite: Driverstation Software and roboRIO imaging tool](#installing-the-frc-update-suite)

!!! tip
	You can install both the **Development Tools** and the **FRC Update Suite** on the same computer or separate computers. Many teams (3255 included) have a development laptop (with both) and a driverstation laptop (with only the FRC Update Suite).

## Installing Java Development Tools

If all you are doing is writing and deploying code to a robot, all you need are the development tools. Following the instructions linked below will get you set up with a development environment and get you setup with all the tools necessary to **program** a robot.

### Installing Java and Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

For **Windows, macOS, or Linux:**

<!-- [Official 2020 FRC installation guide (Windows, macOS, or Linux)](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html) -->

!!! Warning "IMPORTANT NOTE"
	These tools only allow you to program and deploy code to an already imaged roboRIO. They do not allow you to drive the robot or image/update the roboRIO. To accomplish those tasks you must install the [FRC Update Suite](#installing-the-frc-update-suite).

## Installing the FRC Update Suite

If all you are doing is driving an already programmed robot or imaging/updating the roboRIO all you need is the FRC Update Suite. Following the instructions linked below will get you set up with the tools to **drive** the robot and **image/update** the roboRIO.

### Installing the Driverstation software and roboRIO imaging tool

For **Windows ONLY:**
