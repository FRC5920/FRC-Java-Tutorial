- [Installing the FRC Update Suite: Driverstation Software and roboRIO imaging tool](#installing-the-frc-update-suite)

!!! tip
	You can install both the development tools and the FRC Update Suite on the same computer or separate computers. Many teams (us included) have a development laptop (with both) and a driverstation laptop (with only the FRC Update Suite).

## Installing Java Development Tools

If all you are doing is writing and deploying code to a robot all you need are the development tools. Following the instructions linked below will get you set up with a development environment and get you setup with all the tools necessary to **program** a robot.

### Installing Java and Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

!!! Warning "IMPORTANT NOTE"
	These tools only allow you to program and deploy code to an already imaged roboRIO. They do not allow you to drive the robot or image/update the roboRIO. To accomplish those tasks you must install the [FRC Update Suite](#installing-the-frc-update-suite).
