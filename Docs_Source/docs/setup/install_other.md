# Installing Necessary Software

## Overview

There are other pieces of software necessary for programming a robot depending on your circumstances. If you are using Talon or Spark Max motor controllers, those have their own debugging tools that are necessary. If you plan on motion profiling for your drivetrain in autonomous, (check our [motion profiling tutorial] for more on that) you will need to download a pathing software as well.

**See table of contents for a breakdown of this section.**


## Installing Pheonix software (for talon motor controllers)

If you are using Talons on your robot, the Pheonix tuner software is a must have. It allows you to deploy software updates, debug/test your talons, and name/organize your talons.

### Installing the Pheonix suite

For **Windows ONLY:**

## Installing Spark Max tuner

If all you are doing is driving an already programmed robot or imaging/updating the roboRIO all you need is the FRC Game Tools. Following the instructions linked below will get you set up with the tools to **drive** the robot and **image/update** the roboRIO.

### Installing the Driverstation software and roboRIO imaging tool

For **Windows ONLY:**

!!! Warning "IMPORTANT NOTE"
	These tools only allow you to drive the robot and image/update a roboRIO. They do not allow you to program the robot. To accomplish those tasks you must install the [Java Development Tools](#installing-java-development-tools).

## Installing the FRC Radio Configuration Utility

In order to enable wireless connectivity to the robot outside of FRC events or to allow connectivity to other network attached devices (i.e.Limelight Vision Camera), you must configure the robot's radio. Following the instructions linked below will get you set up with the Radio Configuration Utility and how to program the radio.
