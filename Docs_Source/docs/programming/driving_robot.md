## Overview

In this section we will be going over:

1. Creating the basic Drivetrain subsystem
2. Adding subsystems to Robot.java, the main file that the robot runs and all other files must be in some way connected to.
3. Creating joysticks and using their axes to control the robot.
4. Creating and using DifferentialDrive and ArcadeDrive to make controlling the robotâ€™s motors an easy process.
5. Deploying code to the roboRIO
