## Overview

This section will help you learn to create a basic elevator or lift subsystem.

This subsystem will contain:

- Two motors in a single gear box
  - Use single encoder to lift to specific distances
- 3 distances 2, 5, 10 inches
  - 3 buttons to get to those distances
- Hard stop safeties using limit switches
  - Top and bottom
- Run motors at 25% speed so we can watch easier
