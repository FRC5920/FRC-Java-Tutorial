# Installing Other Software

## Overview

There are other pieces of software necessary for programming a robot depending on your circumstances. If you are using Talon or Spark Max motor controllers, those have their own debugging tools that are necessary. If you plan on motion profiling for your drivetrain in autonomous, (check our [motion profiling tutorial] for more on that) you will need to download a pathing software as well.

**See table of contents for a breakdown of this section.**


## Installing Pheonix software (for talon motor controllers)

If you are using Talons on your robot, the Pheonix tuner software is a must have. It allows you to deploy software updates, debug/test your talons, and name/organize your talons.

### Installing the Pheonix suite

For **Windows ONLY:**

## Installing Spark Max Client

If you are using Spark Max motor controllers on your robot, the Spark Max tuner software is a must have. It allows you to deploy software updates, debug/test your Spark maxes, and name/organize your Spark Maxes.

### Installing the Spark Max Client

## Installing PathPlanner

In order to utilize motion profiling on a drivetrain, it is extremely helpful to have a tool such as Pathplanner. Pathplanner allows for seamless creation and deployment of motion profiles from your laptop to your robot, and has a nice interface for doing so. There are other available tools we may add in the future if pathplanner does not suit your needs, but we at 3255 found it comprehensive for our motion profiling needs (note, this software is only for driving in autonomous, it is likely not useful for other mechanisms).

### Installing Pathplanner

For **Windows ONLY:**
